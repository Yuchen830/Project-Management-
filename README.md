# Project Management System

## Description

This Full Stack program is designed as a project management tool, which enables users to add new clients (customers), add new projects, view detailed project cards, and further manage them by updating information, deleting specific projects or clients, and also connecting projects to clients.   

Overall, I started the project by creating an Express server and setting up endpoints, schema, and queries with GraphQl. In addition, I used MongoDB Atlas as the data storage tool, and Mongoose is used to connect my server to the database. In the end, for the Front-end of this project, I mainly used React framework, and Apollo Client to query the GraphQL API.
